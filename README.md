## Just Add Water

Just Add Water is a gentle personal growth app.

Currently users can sign up and create short journal entries. The app's resources are private to each user, so users can only create, read, update, and delete their own journal entries.

In future iterations users will also be able to set goals and note their progress towards those goals.
